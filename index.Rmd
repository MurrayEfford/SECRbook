# Preface {-}

This book is about the methods for describing animal populations that have
come to be called 'spatially explicit capture--recapture' or simply 'spatial 
capture--recapture'. We use 'SECR' as a general label for these data and models.

SECR data are observations of marked animals at known locations. The observations are from a well-defined regime of spatial sampling, most commonly with traps, cameras, or some other type of passive detector. SECR models are used to estimate parameters of the animal population, 
particularly the population density. 

```{r, file = "commoncode.R", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE, results="hide"}
# startup code, including library(secr) etc.

## Why SECR? {-}

Non-spatial capture--recapture methods are highly developed and powerful [@obwa78; @wnc02; @cw]. SECR plugs some gaps in non-spatial methods (particularly with respect to density estimation), and has some unexpected benefits:

1. *Freedom from edge effects*  
Estimation of density with non-spatial capture--recapture is dogged by uncertain edge effects. SECR explicitly accounts for edge effects so density estimates are unbiased. 
2. *Reduced individual heterogeneity*  
Unmodelled individual heterogeneity of detection is a universal source of bias in capture--recapture [e.g., @lc24]. Spatial sampling is a potent source of heterogeneity, due to differential access to detectors. SECR models this component of heterogeneity, which then ceases to be a problem.
3. *Scaleable detection model*  
The core detection model in SECR describes the interaction between a single individual and a single detector. Parameter estimates can therefore be used to simulate sampling with novel detector configurations.
4. *Coherent adjustment for effort*  
Known variation in effort, including incomplete use of a detector array, can be modelled without ad hoc covariates.
5. *Spatial pattern (covariates)*  
SECR allows density to be modelled as a function of continuous spatial covariates.

## Why this book? {-}

The literature of SECR has grown beyond the attention spans and time budgets of most users. Major SECR publications are @e04, @be08, @rcsg14, @bf16, @srl19 and @Turek2021.

This book provides both a gentle introduction, in the spirit of [@cw], and more in-depth treatment of important topics. It is software oriented and therefore unashamedly partial and incomplete. Much of the content is drawn from earlier papers and the documentation of R [@R-base] packages. Some topics are yet to be included (e.g., acoustic data) but documentation may be found on the [DENSITY](https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/SECRinR.html) website. Others such as partial identity models [@Augustine2018] have yet to be considered at all.

Part II is mostly independent of software. Other chapters lean heavily on the R package **secr**.

## Software {-}

\index{R packages}
The R package **secr** [@R-secr] provides most of the functionality we will need. 
It performs maximum likelihood estimation for a range of closed-population SECR models[^footnote1]. The Windows application [DENSITY](https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/) [@edr04] has been superceded, although its graphical interface can still come in handy.

[^footnote1]:A closed population is one in which the composition of the population and the activity distributions of individuals can be assumed fixed for the duration of sampling.

Bayesian approaches using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a flexible alternative to maximum likelihood. The R package [nimbleSCR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nimbleSCR) promises to make these methods more accessible[^footnote2]. 
 
[^footnote2]: The earlier Bayesian SECR package **SPACECAP** [@SPACECAP] is no longer maintained and has been archived from CRAN.
 
Add-on packages extend the capability of **secr**:

* **secrlinear** enables the estimation of linear density (e.g., animals per km) for populations in linear habitats such as stream networks ([secrlinear-vignette.pdf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=secrlinear/vignettes/secrlinear-vignette.pdf)). 
* **ipsecr** fits models by simulation and inverse prediction, rather than maximum likelihood; this is a rigorous way to analyse data from single-catch traps ([ipsecr-vignette.pdf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ipsecr/vignettes/ipsecr-vignette.pdf)). 
* **secrdesign** enables the assessment of alternative study designs by  Monte Carlo simulation; scenarios may differ in detector (trap) layout, sampling intensity, and other characteristics ([secrdesign-vignette.pdf](https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secrdesign-vignette.pdf])).
* **openCR**  [@es20] implements open-population models. 

These packages are available from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) repository -- just open R and type `install.packages('xxxx')` where xxxx is the package name.

Other R packages for SECR may be found outside CRAN. A distinct maximum-likelihood implementation by @srl19 is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jaroyle/oSCR). Open-population packages by Ben Augustine and Richard Glennie are also available on GitHub (https://github.com/benaug/OpenPopSCR; https://github.com/r-glennie/openpopscr).
