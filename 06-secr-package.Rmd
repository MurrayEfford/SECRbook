\index{**secr**}

This chapter provides an overview of **secr** [@R-secr]. See the following chapters for details. Text in `this font` refers to R objects that are documented in online help for the **secr** package, or in base R.

## History

**secr** supercedes the Windows program DENSITY, an earlier graphical interface to SECR methods  [@edr04; @e12]. The package was first released in March 2010 and continues to be developed. It implements almost all the methods described by @be08, @ebb09, @e11, @ef13, @ebm13 and @em14. External C++ code [@R-Rcpp] is used for computationally intensive operations. Multi-threading on multiple CPUs with **RcppParallel** [@R-RcppParallel] gives major speed gains. The package is available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ipsecr); the development version is on [GitHub](https://github.com/MurrayEfford/secr).

## Object classes
\index{**secr** !object classes}

**secr** defines a set of R classes[^1] and methods for data from detector arrays and models fitted to those data. To perform an SECR analysis you construct each of these objects in turn. Fig. \@ref(fig:schematic) indicates the relationships among the classes. 

[^1]:Technically, these are S3 classes. A 'class' in R specifies a   particular type of data object and the functions (methods) by which it is manipulated (computed, printed, plotted etc). See the R documentation for further explanation.

Table: (\#tab:essentialclasses) Essential classes in **secr**.

| Class   | Data                                        |
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `traps`  | locations of detectors; detector type ('proximity', 'multi', etc.) |
| `capthist` | spatial detection histories, including a 'traps' object |
| `mask`   | raster map of habitat near the detectors |
| `secr`   | fitted SECR model|
  
```{r schematic, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.cap = "Essentials of the **secr** package"}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/schematic3.png')
```

- Each object class (shaded box) comes with methods to display and manipulate the data it contains (e.g. `print`, `summary`, `plot`, `rbind`, `subset`). 
- The function `read.capthist` forms a 'capthist' object from input in two files, one the detector layout (saved as attribute 'traps') and the other the capture data. 
- By default, a habitat mask is generated automatically by `secr.fit` using a specified buffer around the detectors (traps). The function `make.mask` gives greater control over this step.
- Any of the objects input to `secr.fit` (traps, capthist, mask) may include a dataframe of covariates  saved as an attribute. Covariate names may be used in model formulae; the `covariates` method is used to extract or replace covariates. Use `addCovariates` for covariates from spatial data sources (e.g., shapefile or 'sf' object)
- Fitted secr models may be manipulated with the methods shown on the right. 

## Functions
\index{**secr** !core functions}

For details of how to use **secr** see the help pages and vignettes. 

Table: (\#tab:corefunctions)  Core functions of **secr**. S3 methods are marked with an asterisk. 

|  Function       | Purpose                                           |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|

| `traps`          | extract or replace traps object in capthist |


## Detector types
\index{**secr** !detector types}

Detector type is a character value, an attribute of the 'traps' object. See also Table \@ref(tab:detectortypes).

Table: (\#tab:basicdetectortypes)  Basic detector types in **secr**

| Name | Type | Description                               |
|:------|:----------------|:---------------------------------|
| "single" | single-catch trap | catch one animal at a time |
| "multi" | multi-catch trap | may catch more than one animal at a time |
| "proximity" | binary proximity | records presence at a point without restricting movement |
| "count"^1^ | Poisson count proximity | [binomN = 0] allows >1 detection per animal per time |
|       | Binomial count proximity | [binomN > 0] up to binomN detections per animal per time|

1. The "count" detector type is generic for integer data; the actual type depends on the `secr.fit` argument 'binomN'.

Table: (\#tab:specialdetectortypes) Specialised detector types in **secr**

| Detector   | Description                               |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| "capped" | proximity detector with maximum one animal at a time |
| "polygon" | counts from searching one or more areas |
| "transect" | counts from searching one or more transects |
| "polygonX" | binary data from mutually exclusive areas |
| "transectX" | binary data from mutually exclusive transects |
| "signal" | detections and signal strengths at multiple microphones |
| "telemetry" | locations from radiotelemetry |

Polygon and transect detectors are for binary or count data from [searches](#areasearches)
(e.g., number of detections per animal per polygon per occasion, supplemented by the x-y coordinates of each detection). 
When a study uses multiple search areas or multiple transects, detections may be either independent or dependent (e.g., maximum one per animal per polygon per occasion) as with traps. The dependent or 'exclusive' type is indicated by the suffix 'X'; in this case the counts are necessarily binary. Using the 'polygonX' or 'transectX' detector type ensures that a competing-risk model is fitted.

Acoustic 'signal strength' detectors produce a binary detection vector supplemented by measurements of signal strength, as from an array of microphones.

There is limited support in **secr** for the analysis of locational data from telemetry ('telemetry' detector type). Telemetry data are used to augment capture--recapture data (see `addTelemetry` and [secr-telemetry.pdf]).

## Input

Data input is covered in the data input vignette [secr-datainput.pdf]. One option is to use text files in the formats used by DENSITY; these accommodate most types of data. Two files are required, one of detector (trap) locations and one of the detections (captures) themselves; the function `read.capthist` reads both files and constructs a capthist object. It is also possible to construct the capthist object in two stages, first making a traps object (with `read.traps`) and a captures dataframe, and then combining these with `make.capthist`. This more general route may be needed for unusual datasets.

## Output

Function `secr.fit` returns an object of class `secr`. This is an R list with many components. Assigning the output to a named object saves both the fit and the data for further manipulation. Typing the object name at the R prompt invokes `print.secr` which formats the key results. These include the dataframe of estimates from the `predict` method for `secr` objects. Functions are provided for further computations on `secr` objects (e.g., AIC model selection, model averaging, profile-likelihood confidence intervals, and likelihood-ratio tests). Several of these are listed in Table \@ref(tab:corefunctions).

\index{Units}

One system of units is used throughout **secr**. Distances are in metres and areas are in hectares (ha). The unit of density for 2-dimensional habitat is animals per hectare. 1 ha = 10000 m^2^ = 0.01 km^2^. To convert density to animals per km^2^, multiply by 100. Density in linear habitats (see package **secrlinear**) is expressed in animals per km.

## Documentation
\index{**secr** !documentation}

The primary documentation for **secr** is in the help pages that accompany the package. Help for a function is obtained in the usual way by typing a question mark at the R prompt, followed by the function name. Note the 'Index' link at the bottom of each help page -- you will probably need to scroll down to find it. The index may also be accessed with `help(package = secr)`.

The consolidated help pages are in the file [secr-manual.pdf]. Searching this pdf is a powerful way to locate a function for a particular task. 

Other documentation has traditionally been in the form of pdf vignettes built with **knitr** and available at https://otago.ac.nz/density/SECRinR. That content will be included progressively in this online book.

The **secr** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MurrayEfford/secr) holds the development version, and bugs may be reported there by raising an Issue. New versions will be posted on [CRAN] and noted on https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/, but there may be a delay. For information on changes in each version, type at the R prompt:

```{r, eval=FALSE} 
news (package = "secr") 
```

Help may be sought in online forums such as [phidot] and [secrgroup]. 

## Defining models

By default, the parameters of SECR models are assumed to be constant. We specify more interesting, and often better-fitting, models with the 'model' argument of `secr.fit`.  Here 'models' relates to variation in the parameters that may be explained by known factors and covariates. The workings are explained in detail in Chapters \@ref(Detection) and \@ref(Density).

Models are defined symbolically in **secr** using R formula notation. A separate linear predictor is used for each core parameter.  The core parameters are 'real' parameters in the terminology of MARK [@cw]. Three real parameters are commonly modelled in **secr** 4.6; these are denoted 'D' (for density), 'g0' (or 'lambda0' for 'hazard' models) and 'sigma'.

For example, in `secr.fit(captdata, model = g0~t)` the real parameter g0 is no longer constant, but takes a unique value on each sampling occasion. [Predictors](#linear-submodels) such as `t` are either names from a list known to **secr** or covariates provided by the user.

Other 'real' parameters appear in particular contexts. 'z' is a shape parameter that is used only when the [detection function](#detectfn) has three parameters. Some detection functions primarily model the cumulative hazard of detection, rather than the probability of detection; these use the real parameter 'lambda0' in place of 'g0'. A further 'real' parameter is the mixing proportion 'pmix', used in [finite mixture models](#finite-mixtures) and [hybrid mixture models](#hybrid-mixtures).

## Fitting models

Models are fitted in `secr.fit` by numerically maximizing the likelihood. The likelihood integrates over the unknown
locations of the animals' activity centres. This is achieved in practice by summing over points in the [habitat mask](#Habitat), which has some implications for the user. Computation may be slow, especially if there are many points in the mask, and estimates may be sensitive to the particular choice of mask (either explicitly in `make.mask` or implicitly via the 'buffer' argument).

The default maximization algorithm is Newton-Raphson in the function `stats::nlm`. By default, all reported variances, covariances, standard errors and confidence limits are asymptotic and based on a numerical estimate of the information matrix, as described [here](#confidenceintervals). 

The Newton-Raphson algorithm is fast, but it sometimes fails to compute the information matrix correctly, causing some standard errors to be set to NA; see the 'method' argument of `secr.fit` for alternatives. Use `confint.secr` for profile likelihood intervals and `sim.secr` for parametric bootstrap intervals (both are slow).

## Parallel processing

On processors with multiple cores it is possible to speed up computation by using cores in parallel. In **secr** 4.6 this happens automatically in `secr.fit` and a few other functions using the multi-threading paradigm of **RcppParallel** [@R-RcppParallel]. The number of threads may be set directly with the function `setNumThreads`, or via the 'ncores' argument of several functions.
