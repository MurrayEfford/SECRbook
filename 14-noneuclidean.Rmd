<!-- ## Non-Euclidean distances -->
 
 <!-- 'Distance' in SECR models usually, and by default, means the -->
 <!-- Euclidean distance $d = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$. The -->
  <!-- observation model can be customised by replacing the Euclidean -->
  <!-- distance with one that 'warps' space in some ecologically meaningful -->
  <!-- way. There are innumerable ways to do this. Royle et al. (2013) -->
  <!-- envisioned an 'ecological distance' that is a function of landscape covariates. Redefining distance is a way to model spatial variation in the size of home ranges, and hence the spatial scale of movement $\sigma$; Efford et al. (2016) use this to model inverse covariation between density and home range size. Distances measured along a linear habitat network such as a river system are also non-Euclidean (see package **secrlinear**). -->
  
  <!-- **secr** provides general tools for specifying and modelling non-Euclidean distance, via the `secr.fit` details component 'userdist'. This may be a user-specified function or a pre-computed matrix. See [secr-noneuclidean.pdf] for a full explanation and examples. -->
