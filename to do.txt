**secr** maintenance
====================

BUG h3?  check link

Test for MLE using Hessian

Polygon assignment cf Ecosphere ms?

Conventions
===========

Echoed code always <= 65 ch
Indent 4

Spelling:
NZ for general language: modelled not modeled, centres not centers etc.
BUT
-ize for discretize, maximize, parameterize

DO NOT
======

Include [] except has defined link

Decisions outstanding
=====================

Repository for code, to relieve some of text?

Refer Shiny apps at GitHub, OU Stats server

Chapters to finish
==================

08 Working with SECR models (AIC, predict etc.)

11 Performance (assumptions, robustness, GoF, speed)

    What to draw from robustness?
    Standardize simulations

12 Study design

13 Simulations

Also:
=====

Ensure all appendices are adequately indicated in main text

Points to include
=================


Unsupported claims
==================

Role of spatial recaptures
  Not precisely defined: is a,b,b one vs b,a,b two?
  Temporal sequence not modelled/recorded
  e.g. @Augustine2020
  
Bayes superior to MLE
  Palmero et al. 2023
  
Bugs
====

readRDS() doesn't like closuresims.RDS downloaded from DENSITY/simulations
