# Spatially explicit capture--recapture

Spatially explicit capture--recapture has opened new possibilities for analysing 
data from wildlife surveys over the last 20 years. Theory and software have advanced 
hand-in-hand with new field techniques. The expanding possibilities are a challenge 
for biologists. 

This volume brings together theory, software and practical advice. It will be used 
by graduate students, wildlife biologists who apply the methods, 
and those wishing to develop them further. Important new material is included 
on study design, a topic of great practical concern. The focus is on 
frequentist models for closed populations fitted in the R package 'secr', but 
much of the material applies equally in a Bayesian context.

The repository contains a first draft of the Quarto book. A rendered HTML version 
of the draft may be accessed at [SECRbook](https://murrayefford.github.io/SECRbook). 
A citable pdf version will be placed on Zenodo after a period of review and revision.

Feedback is warmly welcomed. This includes anything: typos, failure to cite 
your work, conceptual errors, offers of additional content etc. You can raise 
points here as 'Issues' or contact me personally if it's more sensitive.
